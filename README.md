# Water Flow Sensor Arduino Project

This project is designed to monitor water flow using an Arduino and a water flow sensor. It can be used to measure the flow rate, total water usage, and more, making it ideal for various applications such as irrigation systems, water conservation, and monitoring household water usage.

## Introduction

The water flow sensor works by measuring the rate of water passing through the sensor. This project uses an Arduino to read the sensor data and calculate the flow rate and total volume of water used. The data can be displayed on an LCD or sent to a computer via serial communication for further analysis.

## Components Required

- Arduino (e.g., Uno, Nano, etc.)
- Water Flow Sensor (e.g., YF-S201)
- 16x2 LCD Display (optional)
- 10kΩ Potentiometer (for LCD contrast adjustment)
- 220Ω Resistor
- Breadboard and Jumper Wires
- Power Supply (e.g., 9V battery or USB power)

## Circuit Diagram

Below is the basic circuit diagram for connecting the water flow sensor to the Arduino:

```
+-------------------+
| Water Flow Sensor  |
|                   |
|    VCC (Red) ----> +5V on Arduino
|    GND (Black) ---> GND on Arduino
|    Signal (Yellow) -> Digital Pin 2 on Arduino
+-------------------+
```

If you're using an LCD, connect it to the Arduino as follows:

```
LCD Pin  ->  Arduino Pin
-------------------------
VSS      ->  GND
VDD      ->  +5V
VO       ->  Potentiometer Center Pin
RS       ->  Digital Pin 7
RW       ->  GND
E        ->  Digital Pin 8
D4       ->  Digital Pin 9
D5       ->  Digital Pin 10
D6       ->  Digital Pin 11
D7       ->  Digital Pin 12
A/K      ->  +5V/GND (with a resistor in series)
```

## Arduino Code

Here’s a sample Arduino code to get you started:

```cpp
#include <LiquidCrystal.h>

LiquidCrystal lcd(7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12);
const int sensorPin = 2;
volatile int pulseCount = 0;

void setup() {
  pinMode(sensorPin, INPUT);
  digitalWrite(sensorPin, HIGH);
  attachInterrupt(digitalPinToInterrupt(sensorPin), countPulse, RISING);

  lcd.begin(16, 2);
  lcd.print("Flow Rate:");
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  pulseCount = 0;
  interrupts();
  delay(1000);
  noInterrupts();

  float flowRate = pulseCount / 7.5; // Flow rate in liters/min
  lcd.setCursor(0, 1);
  lcd.print(flowRate);
  lcd.print(" L/min");

  Serial.print("Flow Rate: ");
  Serial.print(flowRate);
  Serial.println(" L/min");
}

void countPulse() {
  pulseCount++;
}
```

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Connect the components as described in the circuit diagram.
3. Upload the provided Arduino code to your Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
4. Open the Serial Monitor to view the flow rate or observe it on the LCD.

## Usage

- Ensure that the water flow sensor is properly connected to the water supply.
- Start the Arduino, and the flow rate should be displayed on the LCD or Serial Monitor.
- Use the data to monitor water usage, automate systems, or trigger alerts.

## Troubleshooting

- **No output on LCD:** Check the connections and adjust the potentiometer for contrast.
- **Incorrect flow rate:** Verify that the sensor is properly calibrated and connected.
- **No data on Serial Monitor:** Ensure that the correct COM port is selected and the baud rate is set to 9600.

## Future Improvements

- Add a data logger to save water usage over time.
- Integrate with a home automation system to automatically control water flow.
- Implement wireless communication to send data to a remote server.
